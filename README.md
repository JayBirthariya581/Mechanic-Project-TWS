# Mechanic Side Android Application

This is a part of the Two-Wheeler Doorstep Service Project, which allows mechanics to view the service list with customer and vehicle details and navigate to the exact location of the customer using Google Maps. The app also allows mechanics to enter the inventory items used in the service and upload photos of the service for verification from the manager-side application.

## Features

- **Service List**: Mechanics can view the service list with customer and vehicle details.
- **Location Navigation**: Mechanics can navigate to the exact location of the customer using Google Maps.
- **Inventory Management**: Mechanics can enter the inventory items used in the service.
- **Photo Upload**: Mechanics can upload photos of the service for verification from the manager-side application.

## Technical Details

The app is built using Android Studio and written in Java. Google Maps SDK is integrated into the application to provide location navigation for the mechanics. Firebase Realtime Database is used for the backend, which stores information about services, customers, vehicles, and inventory items. RESTful APIs are used to interact with the database and retrieve data.

The app is designed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which separates the user interface logic from the business logic. The UI components are designed using XML and the layout is managed by the ConstraintLayout.

The app uses Material Design components to provide a modern look and feel. The app also supports multiple languages with the use of localization.

## Getting Started

To run the app, you'll need to clone this repository and open the project in Android Studio. You'll also need to set up a Google Maps API key and a Firebase account and add the respective configuration files to the app. Once you've set up everything, you can build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.
