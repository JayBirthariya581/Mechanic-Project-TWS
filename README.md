# Mechanic Side Android Application

This is an Android application that is part of the Two-Wheeler Doorstep Service Project. The application is designed for mechanics and allows them to view a list of services, customer and vehicle details, navigate to the customer's location using Google Maps, and add inventory items used during the service. Additionally, mechanics can upload photos of the service for verification from the manager side application.

## Technical Details

The application is built using Android Studio and written in Java. Google Maps is integrated into the application to provide location navigation for the mechanic. Firebase Real Time Database is used for the backend, which stores information about services, customers, and inventory items. RESTful APIs are used to interact with the database and retrieve data.

The app is designed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which separates the user interface logic from the business logic. The UI components are designed using XML and the layout is managed by the ConstraintLayout.

The app uses Material Design components to provide a modern look and feel. The app also supports multiple languages with the use of localization.

## Getting Started

To run the app, you'll need to clone this repository and open the project in Android Studio. You'll also need to set up a Google Maps API key and a Firebase account and add the respective configuration files to the app. Once you've set up Google Maps and Firebase, you can build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.
